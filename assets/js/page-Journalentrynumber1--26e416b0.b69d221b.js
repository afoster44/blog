Learning how to set up the professional enviornment is stressful and the only working laptop I have is a Macbook and I have literally never used a MacBook...today was tough and I am a little discouraged because I don't have the funds to buy a PC at this time...commiting to Mac but life could be worse. I also learned today that no matter how much you think you know about coding...you still have so much to learn (I already knew this but it's funny how we always get the reminder). I also learned that I can function in a class setting again. I have not been a student for many years now. I find it is always so tough to go back to learning. Anyway a little ranty, but it's how I felt about day one. The journey has only just begun!!!")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);a.default=o.exports}}]);
