I thought I liked painting because you get to see things come to life quickly, but with the basis of coding it happens faster. I know in the long run a lot what we will do won\'t be all creation, but at this point I enjoy the creation. I will say that one thing I will struggle with is believing in myself. For some reason it is actually my biggest weakness and I think I can say that with confidence. I hope to overcome this and find that my passion fuels my confidence.
